The H-1B visa program, which allows U.S. employers to hire foreign workers in specialized fields such as technology, engineering, and healthcare, has been a hotly debated topic in recent years. Tech moghul Elon Musk and US president-elect Donald Trump have voiced support for the program, while MAGA natives have criticized it, fueling the ongoing discourse on immigration and employment.Typically, H-1B visa is granted for three years but can be extended for an additional three years, offering stability for foreign professionals in the U.S. workforce. According to a 2022 report by U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), the majority of H-1B beneficiaries come from India and China, followed by Canada, South Korea, and the Philippines.
The program is vital for addressing the demand for specialized talent across industries such as technology, healthcare, and finance. While the U.S. government caps the number of new H-1B visas at 65,000 each year, an additional 20,000 visas are available for applicants with a master's degree or higher. This policy ensures that U.S. employers can access highly skilled workers to remain competitive in the global economy. These workers typically fill specialized roles that require expertise not easily found within the domestic workforce.Massachusetts: A Powerhouse for H-1B VisasMassachusetts is a significant sponsor of H-1B visas in the United States. In fiscal year 2024, Massachusetts filed over 5,000 Labor Condition Applications (LCAs) for H-1B visas, with a high approval rate, suggest data from the US Department of Labor.
