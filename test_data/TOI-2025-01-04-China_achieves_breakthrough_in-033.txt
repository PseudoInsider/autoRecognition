China has conducted the world's first satellite-based, ultra-remote surgeries, a breakthrough in medical technology that could transform trauma care, especially in high-intensity combat zones. The operations were performed using the Apstar-6D broadband communications satellite, positioned 36,000km above Earth, according to South China Morning Post.Success streakDoctors from the People's Liberation Army General Hospital successfully conducted five surgeries remotely from Lhasa in Tibet, Dali in Yunnan, and Sanya in Hainan. The patients, located in Beijing, underwent procedures on their liver, gallbladder, or pancreas with the aid of a domestically developed robotic surgical system.
All patients reportedly recovered and were discharged the following day, according to state broadcaster CCTV.Medicinal aid extending to vast areasIn a pioneering feat, data for each surgical movement travelled a two-way distance of nearly 150,000km, demonstrating both domestic and international innovation in medical technology. CCTV reported, "This series of remote surgeries spanned China's mountains and straits, demonstrating the feasibility, safety and effectiveness of performing complex long-distance operations using home-grown satellite technologies and robotic systems."What is Apstar-6D?The Apstar-6D satellite, launched in 2020, played a critical role in this achievement. Capable of delivering 50 gigabits per second and boasting a 15-year lifespan, it provides extensive coverage across the Asia-Pacific region, particularly for air and sea routes.Apstar-6D is the first in a planned constellation of three to four geostationary satellites designed to offer broadband connectivity to aircraft, ships, and remote areas.One of the surgeries involved the removal of a liver tumour by Dr Liu Rong from Lhasa, while the patient was in Beijing. The success of this operation was made possible through advanced communication optimisations, including data classification, Quality of Service control, and traffic management. These measures significantly reduced latency, bringing it close to the physical limits of satellite communication.This milestone signals the potential for satellite-based surgeries to become "a fully normalised and commercialised clinical practice", offering 24/7 global coverage and enabling life-saving interventions in even the most remote locations. Unlike ground-based infrastructure, satellite communication overcomes geographic and logistical constraints, providing broader coverage and faster deployment.In November, China further advanced its satellite communication technology by delivering the Apstar-6E, the country's first all-electric propulsion communications satellite, to Indonesia.
