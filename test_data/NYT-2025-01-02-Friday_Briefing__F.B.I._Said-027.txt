The New Orleans attacker acted alone, the F.B.I. said
Investigators said yesterday that the U.S. Army veteran who plowed a pickup truck into a crowd of New Year's revelers in New Orleans acted alone. They had said earlier in their investigation that they were looking into whether other people might have helped him plant explosives in coolers in the city's French Quarter.
"We're confident, at this point, that there are no accomplices," Christopher Raia of the F.B.I.'s counterterrorism division said at a news conference. The authorities conducted hundreds of interviews and reviews of the attacker's calls, social media accounts and electronic devices.
At least 14 people were killed in the attack on Wednesday and dozens were wounded. Here's what we know about them.
The attacker: Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar, who died in a gunfight with police, served eight years in the U.S. military and was deployed to Afghanistan. Jabbar, who grew up in Texas, said in a video posted online that he had joined the Islamic State group. "He was 100 percent inspired by ISIS," Raia said. Here's what we know about him.
Tight security: Bourbon Street reopened and there was an increased police presence around the venue of the Sugar Bowl, a college football game that was expected to draw a huge crowd. The event had been postponed from Wednesday because of the attack.
A link to another attack? The F.B.I. has found no definitive link between the New Orleans attack and the explosion of a Tesla truck outside a Trump hotel in Las Vegas, but investigators are not ruling anything out. The driver shot himself in the head just before the truck exploded.
Negotiations on a cease-fire for Gaza have stalled
Hamas officials were in Cairo yesterday to meet with Egyptian officials about ways to overcome the impasse in talks on a cease-fire deal in Gaza. Negotiations between Israel and Hamas appear increasingly deadlocked.
President Biden is set to leave office on Jan. 20, making it increasingly likely that his term will end before an agreement is reached.
Israel's military campaign has continued. Yesterday, an Israeli airstrike in Gaza killed Mahmoud Salah, the leader of Gaza's police force, and Hussam Shahwan, a top aide, according to the Hamas-run government media office. The Israeli military claimed responsibility for killing Shahwan but did not comment on Salah's death.
Aid: Israel is moving to ban UNRWA, the U.N. agency that has been the backbone of aid to Gaza, over accusations that it shielded Hamas militants. U.N. officials are preparing to shutter UNRWA's operations as experts warn of a famine threatening parts of the territory.
A piece of space junk fell on a village in Kenya
Joseph Mutua said he was looking after a cow this week when he heard a loud bang. Then a glowing ring of metal weighing nearly half a ton fell out of the sky and landed on his tiny village, southeast of Nairobi. No people, or cows, were hurt.
The object turned out to be from space - junk left over from six decades of space exploration and a growing number of commercial launches. The Kenya Space Agency identified the object as a separation ring from a launch rocket. The ring's origin and ownership were under investigation.

Five days to help you eat better
Ultraprocessed foods are commonly defined as any foods made with artificial flavors and dyes. Scientists have linked them to health issues like heart disease, diabetes, anxiety and depression. If you're interested in figuring out what's in them, and how to cut back on them, my colleagues on the Well desk can help.
Starting Monday, they are kicking off a week of evidence-based tips to better understand ultraprocessed foods. Don't worry. This isn't some drastic overhaul of your diet. You can sign up for the five-day challenge here.
