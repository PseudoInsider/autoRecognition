NEW DELHI: The govt has lodged a strong protest with China over the recent creation of two counties in Hotan prefecture in its northwest, saying parts of these "so-called counties" fall in the Union Territory of Ladakh and India has never accepted the illegal Chinese occupation of Indian territory in this area.The creation of counties will neither have a bearing on India's long-standing and consistent position regarding India's sovereignty over the area nor lend legitimacy to China's illegal and forcible occupation of the same, the external affairs ministry said in response to media queries. The area India referred to falls under Aksai Chin that remains under Chinese control.Separately, India urged Beijing to ensure the interests of downstream states are not harmed because of China's construction of a mega hydropower project on Yarlung Tsangpo river in Tibet.We have lodged a solemn protest with the Chinese side through diplomatic channels," MEA spokesperson Randhir Jaiswal said. The establishment of the counties, both administered by Hotan prefecture, has been approved by the central committee of Communist Party of China and State Council, Xinhua reported last month.MEA also said it had raised the issue concerning the dam in Tibet Autonomous Region of China.
"As a lower riparian state with established user rights to the waters of the river, we have consistently expressed, through expert-level as well as diplomatic channels, our views and concerns to the Chinese side over mega projects on rivers in their territory," Jaiswal said. "These have been reiterated, along with the need for transparency and consultation with downstream countries, following the latest report." China has said the project won't impact the flow of water to the downstream states of Brahmaputra. India and China established expert level mechanism (ELM) in 2006 to discuss issues related to trans-border rivers under which China provides India with hydrological information on the Brahmaputra and Sutlej rivers during the flood season.Data sharing of trans-border rivers figured in the talks between special representatives (SRs) on the border question, NSA Ajit Doval and Chinese foreign minister Wang Yi, held here on Dec 18. The SRs "provided positive directions for cross-border cooperation and exchanges" including data sharing on trans-border rivers, an MEA statement said.The developments related to the dam and the newly-created counties follow signs of thaw in the relationship as India and China ended a border standoff in eastern Ladakh. Following an understanding reached on Oct 21, the two sides completed the disengagement of troops at the two remaining friction points of Demchok and Depsang.PM Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping held talks on the margins of Brics Summit in Russia on Oct 23 and agreed to revive various bilateral dialogue mechanisms, signalling an intention to normalise the relationship.
