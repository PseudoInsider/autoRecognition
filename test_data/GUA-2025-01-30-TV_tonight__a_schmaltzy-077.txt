The Road Trip

Novelist Beth O'Leary is a master of modern romcoms, and here is her second schmaltzy small-screen adaptation (following 2022's The Flatshare). It is a fun, formulaic and far-fetched affair: Addie (Emma Appleton) drives her van to a wedding in Spain, but ends up giving a lift to her ex, Dylan (Laurie Davidson). With their warring friends and a strange chap called Rodney also on board, it's the road trip from hell - but will it end in rekindled love? Hollie Richardson
