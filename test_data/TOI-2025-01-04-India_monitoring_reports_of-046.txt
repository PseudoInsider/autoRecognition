KOLKATA/NEW DELHI: Indian health management agencies and doctors are keeping a wary eye on reports of yet another virus spread in China amid speculations of a new variant of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) emerging. Centre on Friday allayed fears of a Covid-like surge in cases of respiratory infections, as videos of hospitals in China struggling to manage patients made rounds on social media.
"There is news doing the rounds about an HMPV outbreak in China. HMPV is a normal respiratory virus which causes symptoms like cold. Some people can get flu-like symptoms, especially the elderly and infants. But this is not something serious or worrisome," Atul Goel, director general of health services, said.He added that during winters, respiratory infections tend to rise. "Our hospitals are prepared to deal with such an increase. We have sufficient beds and oxygen supplies," Goel said, adding that so far there hasn't been any substantial increase in respiratory infection cases in India. Bengal health officials said they were keeping a close watch on the situation and would coordinate with the health ministry for any direction on countermeasures. "While there is no reason to panic, we remain vigilant," said a senior health official.According to doctors in Kolkata, HMPV is a relatively innocuous virus and city hospitals have treated several patients this winter as well. The National Center for Disease Control (NCDC) is closely monitoring cases of respiratory infections and seasonal influenza.
