In 2023, on a research trip to Panama, I booked a day tour of the Panama Canal. I expected to hear the usual story about the canal's epic construction, importance in world trade and successful expansion to allow for larger modern ships. What I did not expect was the overwhelming sense of concern, even panic, among people who depend on the canal for their livelihoods.
It was July, the middle of Panama's rainy season. But the rains had been sparse, and water levels in the canal had sunk to troubling lows. Without freshwater from rain, our guide explained, the locks on the canal could not operate.
I remembered that visit after President-elect Donald Trump said recently that the Chinese were threatening America's interests at the canal, and he engaged in some saber rattling by suggesting that the United States could take back control of the passage, which was returned to Panama exactly 25 years ago Tuesday. The handover treaties were a signature achievement of President Jimmy Carter, who died on Sunday; Mr. Trump's comments were in keeping with longstanding criticism that the move was a strategic mistake.
But Mr. Trump misunderstands the true threat to U.S. commerce through Panama. If the goal is securing affordable access to the transit point over the long term, it is climate change, not Chinese influence, that U.S. policymakers should worry about.
Here's why. Sending a single ship through the canal's locks can use around 50 million gallons of water, mainly freshwater collected from Lake Gatún. Though the canal is, for the moment, operating at full capacity, a drier climate and greater demand for drinking water have in recent years reduced the volume of available water. That has forced the state-run Panama Canal Authority at times to limit the number of daily passages through the canal, at one point by as much as 40 percent.
With less rain, the reservoirs fill up more slowly, which means less water available to operate the locks, which means fewer ships can pass. Hence, the 2023-24 drought, among the worst on record, slowed transits and drove up transit prices, causing long delays, more expensive consumer goods and greater instability in shipping routes. These were probably the increases Mr. Trump referred to as a "rip-off."
The limited number of passages has led to auctions for passage rights that further inflated the growing cost of shipping goods through the canal. (The canal authority increased tolls just before the 2023 drought began.) In the short term, reduced access causes goods to take longer to reach their destinations, and they cost more when they arrive. Over the medium term, companies have begun to seek alternate routes and different methods of moving goods. Some projects, like a railway corridor across southern Mexico, have emerged to directly compete with the Panama Canal. Over the long term, as trade volume and ship sizes increase while the amount of available water decreases, the canal could well lose market share, declining in both usefulness and strategic importance.
The 2023-24 drought was due in part to a strong El Niño effect, as rising surface temperatures in the Pacific Ocean altered weather patterns worldwide. Scientists generally agree that climate change is making El Niño events more frequent and more severe. Higher temperatures have increased the evaporation of water off the reservoir, too, further reducing the water supply.
Mr. Trump's insinuations about Chinese influence, his demands for lower transit fees and his talk of returning the canal to U.S. control have, of course, not won him admiration in Panama, least of all among civic leaders more concerned with solving the canal's challenges.
In recent days, President José Raúl Mulino of Panama has repeatedly rejected accusations of Chinese influence. He declared at a news conference last week that "the Panama Canal is Panamanian and belongs to Panamanians" and that Panamanian control of the waterway had cost the country "blood, sweat and tears." There is no legal mechanism by which Mr. Trump might demand its return.
Panamanians are rightly proud of their administration of the canal over the past 25 years; in suggesting that the United States retains any claim to it, Mr. Trump risks alienating a country that remains friendly to the United States despite a long history of U.S. arrogance toward the Panamanian people.
Panama has been a global crossroads since the 19th century. A sea route across the isthmus was first imagined by the Spanish in the 16th century; the overland route between the oceans rose to prominence in the 1840s and 1850s during the California Gold Rush. Through the 19th century, the United States competed against other imperial powers, mainly Britain and France, for land and influence in Central America. Controlling Panama was a key feature of the American rise to hemispheric dominance and overseas empire in the wake of the Spanish-American War of 1898.
Panamanians have benefited from that competition, but they have equally been victimized by it: Panama became independent in 1903, but sovereignty came at the cost of ceding the Canal Zone to the United States. Both before and after the construction of the canal, U.S. military intervention was a constant threat. Since the 1840s, the United States has intervened frequently to protect its commercial interests in Panama. U.S. troops deployed to Panama 13 times from 1856 to 1903. Most seriously, an invasion in 1989 resulted in the deaths of hundreds of Panamanian civilians; unofficial estimates put the number in the thousands.
The history of U.S.-Panama relations is neither simple nor straightforward. The United States built the canal, and without support from the U.S. military, Panama probably would not have been able to secede from Colombia and establish itself as an independent nation. The United States has served as an occupier but also a major trading partner, ally and source of cultural influence.
Many Americans have Panamanian roots, and an increasing number of Americans live in Panama. Now migrants from places such as Haiti and Venezuela are crossing the Daríén Gap straddling Colombia and Panama en route to the United States, prompting a fresh humanitarian emergency and new challenges for both Panama and the United States. These are nations whose fates are tied together.
From Panama to Greenland, Mr. Trump's expansionist ambitions point to a larger truth: In a world increasingly dependent on extended supply chains that crisscross the globe, mastery of logistics translates to economic security. Taking Panama (as Teddy Roosevelt did), Mr. Trump imagines, might secure U.S. access to the canal, and buying Greenland (as he has also suggested) would guarantee a U.S. presence at the entrance to a future northwest passage through the melting Arctic ice. In Mr. Trump's view of international competition, it seems sea routes are to be seized, controlled and monopolized, not shared among nations with equal access to all, as the Panama Canal is.
Costs of transiting the canal are going up. But neither so-called Panamanian greed nor Chinese influence determines these costs. The truth is more straightforward, if more daunting: If we want to ensure fair, equal and sustainable access to the canal, it is climate change we'll have to beat, not the Chinese.
