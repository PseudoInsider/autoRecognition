To the Editor:
''The President's Arsenal'' (editorial, Dec. 17) makes clear that nuclear war is the single greatest risk facing the United States and the world.
President-elect Donald Trump seems to understand that we are one miscalculation away from unleashing unfathomable destruction. This should compel him to take the lead in opening a serious dialogue among the nuclear-armed nations. A good beginning would be a joint no-first-use pledge with Russia and China, reversing the shortsighted policies of all previous presidents since World War II allowing for the first use of nuclear weapons.
But he can and must go further. Contrary to your assertion that ''Abolition is something the United States has not seriously considered -- and cannot now afford to consider,'' abolition must be the goal. President Ronald Reagan's pursuit of arms control was grounded in his steadfast belief that humanity and nuclear weapons cannot forever coexist. On Jan. 16, 1984, he stated, ''Indeed, I support a zero option for all nuclear arms. As I've said before, my dream is to see the day when nuclear weapons will be banished from the face of the Earth.''
Mr. Trump has the chance to fulfill Reagan's dream -- and literally save the world.

To the Editor:
While your editorial focuses on the first use of nuclear weapons, any decision to order their use -- whether first use or in retaliation -- is too momentous to rest with any one person.
Fortunately, there is an approach -- supported by former Defense Secretary William J. Perry -- that could be instituted using existing systems.
Any nuclear attack plan should require a presidential order and agreement by the next two people in the presidential chain of succession. Under normal circumstances, these would be the vice president and the speaker of the House.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency ensures presidential continuity if the president dies or is incapacitated, by continuously tracking the location of officials in the line of succession and maintaining the ability to communicate with them securely in real time.
This system would allow the Pentagon to communicate quickly and simultaneously with all three people. The president alone would have the authority to order a specific attack, but either of the other two could veto the order.
It would not eliminate the risk of nuclear war, but it would diminish it.

To the Editor:
When President-elect Donald Trump assumes office on Jan. 20, 2025, he will once again be the most powerful man in the world as he retakes control of our nuclear arsenals. Your article offers a blueprint for Mr. Trump to save humanity and ensure a legacy to be among the greatest presidents ever by abolishing nuclear weapons.
Nearly 80 years after the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki ushered in the nuclear age, the world finds itself in the midst of a new arms race and arguably closer to nuclear conflict than at any time since. The president-elect has acknowledged the danger, referring to the fire and fury of nuclear war and the fact that the world would never recover.
There is a grass-roots movement, Back From the Brink (I am on its steering committee), that calls on the United States, and by extension the president, to indeed step back. Like your editorial, it calls on the United States to resume arms-control talks. In addition, it calls for renouncing the first use of nuclear weapons, ending sole presidential authority to launch, canceling the rebuilding of our nuclear arsenal and ending hair-trigger launch alert.
The people are demanding these weapons be eliminated before they eliminate us. What is needed is the courage to act.

The Debate Over Work Visas
To the Editor:
Re ''Immigration Pits Ally Against Ally in Trump's Orbit'' (front page, Dec. 28):
I would argue against H-1B visas for skilled immigrants not because of their economic impact on the U.S. economy, but because of the effect on the rest of the world.
Talented workers from poor countries come here for training or work, to benefit themselves and our industries, possibly with the dream of returning to their countries to aid in their development. But how many of them go back? They get poached, or seduced, to stay here and conduct their entire work lives in the United States.
The rich countries get richer, the poor countries get poorer, unbalancing the world even further. And then we complain about illegal immigrants fleeing poverty!

Unreliable Polls
To the Editor:
Re ''Polls' Strength in 2024: Spotting the Big Trends,'' by Nate Cohn (The Upshot, Dec. 15):
Mr. Cohn claims ''a decent case'' can be made that the 2024 polls were ''the best they've ever been,'' indeed that they ''excelled'' if measured by value more than accuracy.
Seriously? That analysis -- relying on data about certain voter subgroups -- might be accepted by a few statisticians in a laboratory, but it is totally divorced from what the general public encountered. The polls portrayed an election that was unbearably close. The reality was the opposite: an undisputed one-party sweep of the presidency, both houses of Congress, all seven swing states, the popular vote and the Electoral College.
Unfortunately, the pundits and the media treated the polls not as fallible predictions but as completely accurate portrayals of the likely outcome. Accordingly, they projected a post-election scenario of divided government, protracted litigation and a threatened democracy. This characterization dominated media coverage of the campaign and overwhelmed serious reporting about the candidates and the issues.
In future campaigns, the media must revise the way it covers polls. Their significance should be downplayed and their uncertainties exposed. They should never replace good old-fashioned reporting by skilled journalists.
Moreover, members of the media should no longer sponsor their own polls. To do so creates a substantial conflict of interest. How can a media outlet objectively report on, question or give proper weight to a poll that it has sponsored and financed? Instead, it publishes exercises in self-justification like Mr. Cohn's article.

Cruelty and Christianity
To the Editor:
Re ''Why Are So Many Christians So Cruel?,'' by David French (column, Dec. 23):
Mr. French's column resonated deeply with me. The question he posed is one I have pondered repeatedly, both before the 2024 presidential campaign and certainly during Donald Trump's victory run.
As a practicing Catholic greatly saddened by the election's outcome, I reframe the question in more secular terms: ''Why would so many Americans be willing to vote for a man so undeniably cruel, vile and selfish?'' The answer appears to be very simple: The high price of bacon, eggs and gas was more important than their professed faith.

To the Editor:
The reason that politics and religion are a toxic mixture is that it changes the argument from ''I'm right and you're wrong'' to ''I'm good and you're evil.''
