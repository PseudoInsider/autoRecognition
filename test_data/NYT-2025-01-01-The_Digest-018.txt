U.S. Demand Hits Record For Liquefied Natural Gas
U.S. natural gas demand from L.N.G. plants hit a record on Tuesday, the last day of the year, climbing to 15.2 billion cubic feet in a sign of a strong year ahead from the startup of two new gas-processing plants, preliminary data from the financial firm LSEG showed.
U.S. natural gas demand for liquefied natural gas plants is forecast to rise to 17.8 billion cubic feet per day in 2025 with the commissioning of Venture Global LNG's Plaquemines plant in Louisiana and Cheniere Energy's Corpus Christi Stage 3 expansion in Texas.
Demand for natural gas by L.N.G. export plants could spur higher production in the U.S. and increase prices at the country's main gas exchange in Louisiana, called Henry Hub, according to analysts.
Gas prices were up 48 cents in midday trading on Tuesday, at $3.94 per million cubic feet, according to LSEG data. REUTERS

New York Cocoa Leads World as West Africa Lags
New York cocoa was the strongest performing commodity in 2024 with prices more than doubling after poor crops in West Africa.
Ivory Coast and Ghana, the world's top two cocoa growers, both saw a sharp drop in production in the 2023-24 season.
New York cocoa futures on ICE settled on Tuesday at $11,675 a metric ton, posting an annual gain of 178 percent.
Prices rose to a record high of $12,931 a ton on Dec. 18.
Cocoa prices have risen sharply for a second successive year after climbing by 61 percent in 2023.
No. 2 grower Ghana has had a particularly difficult time because of soaring rates of swollen shoot disease, aging trees, illegal gold mining, climate change and sector mismanagement.

U.S. Rare Earths Processor Is Drawing Investment
BMW and Yamaha Motor have invested in Phoenix Tailings, a U.S.-based rare earths processing start-up, the latest move to boost production of the strategic metals outside of China.
Rare earths are a group of 17 metals used to make magnets that turn power into motion for electric vehicles, cellphones and other electronics.
The existing standard to refine these minerals, known as solvent extraction, is an expensive and dirty process that gradually became unpopular in the United States after it was developed in the 1950s but one that Chinese rivals have spent the past 30 years mastering.
Beijing has taken steps in recent months to curb exports, a move that has fueled a scramble across the West for replacement technologies. Phoenix Tailings says its process can produce rare earths from mined ore or recycled equipment with little to no emissions. REUTERS
