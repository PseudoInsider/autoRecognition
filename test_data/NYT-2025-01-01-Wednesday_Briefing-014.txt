The end of a turbulent 2024.
Welcome to 2025
It's been a year, hasn't it? There was a lot to cover.
Donald Trump stormed back to the White House after his felony conviction. The wars in the Middle East and Ukraine raged on. A.I. became an even bigger part of our lives. Evan Gershkovich, a journalist at The Wall Street Journal, was freed after being imprisoned by Russia. Paris offered a stunning backdrop for the Olympic Games. And Charli XCX's "Brat" album swept the internet, becoming the soundtrack of the summer.
What will 2025 bring? Elections in Australia, Belarus, Germany and Poland, among other nations. A second Trump administration. (The year is also the first since 1936 to be a square number.) In the first hours of 2025, people gathered to celebrate, as fireworks crackled in cities large and small. See photographs from New Year's events around the world.
We hope you're able to take a moment to reflect not only on the big and difficult moments of this year but also on small pockets of joy. We hope you closed out the year on a high note - or, at least, a calm one. And thank you so much for starting your day - and your year - with The New York Times.

Our 2025 predictions
Without a crystal ball to rely on, we asked around the newsroom for thoughts and forecasts for the year to come.
David Sanger, who covers the White House and foreign policy, said he would be watching for three major indicators of how Trump would handle a world on fire. "The early test may be his approach to a weakened Iran: Strike the nuclear program or strike a deal?" he said. And the second, he continued, "is whether Trump tries to force a deal on Ukraine."
"Then there is the biggest question of all," he said. "Does Trump have a strategy to interfere with the Russia-China-Iran-North Korea partnership? That did not exist during his first term. It has the potential to define his second."
Our food reporter, Kim Severson, shared some predictions, too: savory coffees, great convenience-store cuisine and sauces on everything. And our Styles desk pulled together its annual list of predictions. Among them: Pandan will take the spotlight, plant-based skin care will have its moment, and tartan will find new relevance.
Your best resolutions
With the start of the new year, some of you may be thinking about your 2025 goals. For a little inspiration, we asked readers to share their most successful resolutions and how they kept them. Here's what they said:
To fill my life with more joyful activities, see more friends and get creative. I created a WhatsApp group with around 20 female friends, some of whom I hadn't really seen since before Covid. We're in our 40s and called it "Rage against the machine." Since starting this, we've gone walking, camping, raving. I've reconnected with old friends and brought joy back into my life! - Debbie Clarke, Nottingham, England
To be more present with myself and the people around me. When I was with friends, my phone stayed in my bag so as to avoid the distraction and so as to actively listen to what they are talking about. I tried to spend some time during the week in nature at the park. And every night before going to bed, I spent a minute or two either writing down what I'm grateful for or doing a mental body scan. - Stephania Xenophontos, Nicosia, Cyprus
To take that trip. In early 2024, you asked readers what was the best advice they'd ever received. One lady wrote, "Book the Trip." That advice became my 2024 resolution. I booked a trip to the Great Barrier Reef which had been on my bucket list for ages. Furthermore, I traveled solo. The entire experience was fantastic. My 2025 resolution is to keep traveling and book another trip! - Margaret Anne Breuer, Sarasota, Fla.
To write a gratitude letter to someone every day. I kept the resolution by turning it into a simple daily ritual. By the end of the year, I had written 365 letters to friends, family, teachers, mentors and even people I hadn't spoken to in years. What surprised me most was how this resolution didn't just impact the people receiving the letters - it also transformed the way I saw the world. By focusing on gratitude daily, I deepened my relationships, rekindled old ones and learned to find beauty in even the smallest moments of connection. - Joelle Roth, Makati, Philippines
To cut out caffeine. It was my sister's New Year's resolution. When she said she'd stop drinking coffee, I thought to myself I should be able to do the same. The sheer competition kept me going. It took weeks of headaches, brain fog and other physical and emotional withdrawal symptoms. Months later, I triumphantly declared myself coffee-free on the family WhatsApp channel - just for my sister to say that she actually never gave up coffee. - Teresa Olbert, Bijilo, Gambia
