Hyderabad: Calling for united efforts to preserve Telugu, Union coal and mines minister G Kishan Reddy has said the movement for preserving the language should begin from home.
He expressed concern over Telugu being used very little at home as a conversational language among the Telugus and said now even on social media, Telugu words are being transliterated in English.
Kishan Reddy suggested that arguments in courts, judgments, and Telugu film titles should be in Telugu. All Telugus should resolve to speak in Telugu at their homes, especially with their children. He said human intelligence develops in the mother tongue from the mother's womb.
"We should learn English only for (the purpose of) job," he said, while speaking at the 12th Biennial Congress of the World Telugu Federation conference here on Saturday.
"Countries such as China, Japan, South Korea, and Germany impart education, even subjects like space science, in their own languages. That did not hinder the development of those nations. Development does not require reliance on English. Our perception should change, which comes from our colonial legacy," Kishan Reddy added.
"Even during the Nizam's time, a struggle was waged through movements like Granthala Yodyam and the Andhra Mahasabha to protect the language despite and against imposing Urdu as the primary language in schools," Kishan Reddy, who is also BJP state president, said during the event.
The Union minister also stated that Modi govt's National Education Policy also talks about promoting the mother tongue and providing textbooks in native languages
