Microsoft has offered the US a roadmap to win AI race vs China. In a blog post, Microsoft President Brad Smith wrote that the United States needs an overarching national strategy to ensure it prevails in the global AI race -- focusing on R&D funding at universities, education, and workforce development, and ensuring that American tech companies aren't slowed down by "heavy-handed regulations". The blog post comes just days ahead of President-elect Donald Trump's second term.The post focuses in part on the competitive threat posed by China in artificial intelligence as well as looks to underscore Microsoft's role in advancing AI development. China and the United States are racing to spread their AI systems to other countries in an effort to become the de facto standard, according to Smith.The blog post titled 'The Golden Opportunity for American AI' has also been shared by Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella.
US needs a smart international strategy China has started offering developing countries subsidized access to scarce computer chips and help building local AI datacenters, according to Smith. "The Chinese wisely recognize that if a country standardizes on China's AI platform, it likely will continue to rely on that platform in the future," Smith said.He said that US has several advantages, "The United States currently has multiple advantages. American companies currently have better technology, from chips to AI models to software applications. In addition, many US companies, including Microsoft, have invested heavily in building AI that is more trustworthy than most products from China. We are designing AI technology that protects cybersecurity, privacy, digital safety, and other responsible uses of AI.""Given the nature of technology markets and their potential network effects, this race between the US and China for international influence likely will be won by the fastest first mover," Smith reasoned. "The best response for the United States is not to complain about the competition but to ensure we win the race ahead. This will require that we move quickly and effectively to promote American AI as a superior alternative. And it will need the involvement and support of American allies and friends."Hence, the United States needs a smart international strategy to rapidly support American AI around the world." While summing up he further stressed on American products being more trustworthy than Chinese, "Finally, the United States is in a strong position to win the essential race with China by advancing international adoption of American AI. American products are more trusted than their Chinese counterparts, and our private sector is unmatched in its ability to invest in infrastructure around the world. With a balanced and common-sense approach to export control policy, the United States can solidify the diplomatic relations that will be critical to global AI adoption," he wrote.
