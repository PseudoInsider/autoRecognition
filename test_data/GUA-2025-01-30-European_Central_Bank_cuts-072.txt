Closing summary: Christine Lagarde leaves door open for lower ECB interest rates
The European Central Bank did nothing to direct investors away from the consensus view that it plans to ease interest rates further over the course of 2024. It announced fifth cut in seven months on Thursday.
President Christine Lagarde said that ECB policy is still "restrictive", meaning it is bearing down on growth and inflation. Much of the discussion in the press conference revolved around the "neutral rate" at which monetary policy neither stimulates nor restricts growth. Lagarde suggested that any esimates of that were "premature", suggesting that the bank has further to go in cutting rates.
Meanwhile, economic growth in the eurozone is "set to remain weak in the near term" , she said.
Financial markets were mostly unmoved on Thursday as Lagarde delivered a message very much in line with expectations.
Perhaps the statement that will live on the longest from the press conference was Lagarde's strong disavowal of bitcoin having any chance of entering central bank reserves.
She said that reserve assets must be liquid, safe, and secure.
I am confident that bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the members of the general council.
It came after the head of the Czech central bank said that he would consider shifting reserves into bitcoin, and Donald Trump said the US would build up a strategic bitcoin reserve after allying himself with cryptocurrency advocates during the presidential election campaign.

Back to that US GDP reading , at a 2.3% annualised rate for the fourth quarter it was the weakest end to a year since 2018.
Samuel Tombs, chief US economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said that the world's largest economy was held up by the consumer, but that may not last. He wrote:
Economic growth became increasingly reliant on households last year, with the 4.2% surge in consumers' spending in Q4 driving essentially all of the overall increase in GDP, offsetting a big drag from inventories and weakness in investment.
However, we would caution against concluding that underlying domestic demand remains unassailably strong. We think that a substantial share of the gain in consumption in Q4 reflected households pulling forward purchases in anticipation of tariffs threatened by the new administration.
"Consumer spending remained resilient, while investment was weaker," said Richard Flax, chief investment officer at Moneyfarm, an online wealth manager.
Despite [the weakening growth], the US economy has managed to avoid the long-feared recession following the Covid-19 pandemic. Investors are now trying to determine if the Federal Reserve will begin cutting interest rates again in 2025, after maintaining them on Wednesday. In a press conference, Powell stated that the economy "remains strong" while inflation "remains somewhat elevated."

The last questions focus on real incomes and Bulgaria 's economic convergence with the EU.
Lagarde says that there has been a catch-up in real incomes compared with pre-pandemic levels. She says that she hopes that consumers will spend more (rather than saving) despite "a degree of uncertainty about European political developments".
The convergence between Bulgaria and the rest of the EU is going well, she says.
And with that the press conference is over.

The next questions covered her discussions with European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen and the relationship with the US Federal Reserve  after it withdrew from a green policy forum.
Von der Leyen gave a presentation about the Commission's policies on restoring competitiveness and innovation, but also to hear from ECB governors, Lagarde says.
On the Fed, she says that there is "huge value" in the Network for Greening the Financial System, from which the US central bank withdrew. It has "great value" for policymakers, she said.
block-time published-time 2.25pm GMT
The next question goes back to the neutral rate debate.
Christine Lagarde says the debate about what the neutral rate is is "entirely premature" because European monetary policy is still restrictive.
She says that it's not possible to say whether the bank would lower rates below the notional netural rate to stimulate growth. She says:
I cannot tell you that!

Lagarde is asked if the eurozone economic recovery is delayed.
First of all, there is recovery, she says. The economy is not at potential yet, but it is certainly a recovery, she says. The ECB has good reason to believe that consumption will pick up, and the weak fourth quarter in the eurozone does not reflect the whole year of 2024.
Recovery there is; stagflation there is not.
Asked about recent bond yield increases that have troubled governments around the world (including the UK) , she says that most of that is "largely spillovers" from the US as investors adjusted to Trump's inflationary policies.

Bitcoin will not be added to reserves of European central banks, says Lagarde
Lagarde is asked her confidence on the inflation target, and about a strategic bitcoin reserve.
On bitcoin, she says the cryptocurrency will not be added to the reserves of the central banks that make up the European Central Bank.
She says that bitcoin is plagued by the suspicion of money laundering and other criminal activity. She says:
I am confident that bitcoins will not enter the reserves of any of the central banks of the members of the general council.
On the inflation target, there is one item that is still resisting the disinflation (fall in inflation) seen everywhere else - services inflation - Lagarde says. We look carefully at services, she says. All the indicators on wages are heading down at the moment. She said:
We are not celebrating that, but we are taking note.
The ECB has confidence that wages are on their way down and will impact on the price of services, she says.

Lagarde is asked whether it is realistic to believe that exports will contribute to economic growth in light of Trump's tariffs, and why the ECB didn't discuss a bigger cut of 50 basis points.
Lagarde says:
We did not even utter the two numbers five-zero. 50 was not in the discussion at all.
On exports, she says they analyse uncertainty around trade as a potential risk, but they don't have enough certainty on Trump's trade policy to be confident.
There are rumours, there are statements, there are assumptions, but we don't have any clear, tangible numbers.
By March, "we will still be plagued by uncertainty" on trade, Lagarde says.

On to the questions. Lagarde is asked about the future direction of interest rates and the neutral rate (at which policy is perceived as neither inflationary nor disinflationary).
All governors supported the ECB's position in a unanimous vote.
She says the ECB is still in "restrictive" territory.
We know the direction of travel, Lagarde says, but emphasises that the pace will depend on data that comes in after that.
And on the neutral interest rate, Lagarde says that the ECB will publish details of changes to the estimated rate.

Greater friction in global trade could weigh on growth, Christine Lagarde said.
Global economic risks "remain tilted to the downside", she said. Heightened geopolitical tensions could increase inflation if it pushes up logistical costs.
However, she did not come down either way on whether Trump's proposed tariffs will add to eurozone inflation. She said:
Greater friction in global trade would make the inflation outlook in the euro area more uncertain.
block-time published-time 1.57pm GMT
Inflation is expected to fluctuate around its current level in the near term, Lagarde said.
Recent signals point to moderating wage pressures. Most measures of longer-term inflation expectations remain around 2%.

Christine Lagarde: Europe's economy 'set to remain weak in the near term'
European Central Bank president Christine Lagarde has said that the "economy stagnated" and "It is set to remain weak in the near term".

Nevertheless, the conditions for a recovery remain in place.

Melanie Debono, senior Europe economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, another consultancy, has done a bit of central bank rune-reading.
Her verdict is that the ECB is sticking to the same path outlined in December. She wrote:
The key line in the decision statement is unchanged, which means that it still includes little in the way of forward guidance, instead pledging data-dependency. It again states that "The Governing Council is determined to ensure that inflation stabilises sustainably at its 2% medium-term target. It will follow a data-dependent and meeting-by-meeting approach to determining the appropriate monetary policy stance."
Recall that the text was edited in December to remove the reference to the need for a "sufficiently restrictive" policy rate. These words were removed to pave the way for further easing. We continue to look for the ECB to trim rates twice more in the current easing cycle, specifically by 25 basis points in March and in June, such that the deposit rate reaches a terminal rate of 2.25%.
block-time published-time 1.37pm GMT
Back to the European Central Bank, Jack Allen-Reynolds, deputy chief eurozone economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said the rate cut was "no surprise".
The accompanying statement implies that more cuts are coming, as is widely anticipated. We think the bank will have to lower interest rates further than most investors expect.
The statement is very similar to last month's. It describes domestic inflation as "high" but notes that this is mostly due to the lagging components of inflation. The overall tone shows that policymakers are confident that inflation will soon return sustainably to the target.

US economy slowed more than expected at end of 2024

ECB: inflation 'on track' while economy faces 'headwinds'
The European Central Bank has said that "the disinflation process is well on track", suggesting that it is comfortable with cutting interest rates.
The bank noted that the eurozone "economy is still facing headwinds but rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in demand over time".
On inflation, it said:
The disinflation process is well on track. Inflation has continued to develop broadly in line with the staff projections and is set to return to the Governing Council's 2% medium-term target in the course of this year. Most measures of underlying inflation suggest that inflation will settle at around the target on a sustained basis. Domestic inflation remains high, mostly because wages and prices in certain sectors are still adjusting to the past inflation surge with a substantial delay. But wage growth is moderating as expected, and profits are partially buffering the impact on inflation.
And on the broader economy's performance, it said:
The Governing Council's recent interest rate cuts are gradually making new borrowing less expensive for firms and households. At the same time, financing conditions continue to be tight, also because monetary policy remains restrictive and past interest rate hikes are still transmitting to the stock of credit, with some maturing loans being rolled over at higher rates. The economy is still facing headwinds but rising real incomes and the gradually fading effects of restrictive monetary policy should support a pick-up in demand over time.

European Central Bank cuts interest rates by 0.25 percentage points
The European Central Bank has cut its key interest rate by 0.25 percentage points to 2.75% in an effort to stimulate growth in the struggling eurozone economy.
The rate-setting governing council has now cut interest rates five times since the start of summer 2024.
The cut was widely expected by financial market traders and economists as the ECB responds to weak growth in the eurozone's key economies. Eurozone GDP did not grow in the last three months of 2024, according to a preliminary reading published on Thursday.
The bank's president, Christine Lagarde, will give more details of the reasons behind the rate cut at a press conference at 1:45pm GMT.

Let's get the lay of the land ahead of the European Central Bank's interest rate announcement at 1:15pm GMT.
Economists and investors will be taken by surprise if the ECB does not cut its deposit rate by 0.25 percentage points (25 basis points), down to 2.75% from 3%.
The bank, led by Christine Lagarde, cut interest rates four times in 2024 , down from 4%. The most recent cut was in December last year.
The ECB is expected to continue further down that path this year, as many of Europe's major economies struggle with tepid growth and political volatility.
Jim Reid and analyst colleagues at Deutsche Bank said that a 25 basis point cut is widely expected. They wrote:
So the bigger question will be how long they'll continue to cut rates, particularly with core inflation still lingering above 2%. For today, our European economists share that view expecting another 25bp cut, and think the description of the policy stance will be unchanged relative to the last meeting in December. However, the main risk for them is that the ECB will tweak the description of recent data in a hawkish-leaning direction.
Another key issue will be the judgement from Lagarde on the likely impact of Donald Trump's tariff policy - although given that his administration has not revealed any details there will be some uncertainty from the ECB.
Holger Schmieding, an economist at Berenberg, an investment bank, said:
For the Eurozone, the impact of US tariffs would show up mostly in less growth rather than in changes in prices. As a rough guess, a 10% US tariff on all imports from the Eurozone and the ensuing uncertainty about future US-EU commercial relations could reduce Eurozone growth by 0.3-0.5 percentage points within one year after the start of such a trade war. For the ECB, this would be an argument to cut rates below the 2.25% which we currently project as the trough for the deposit rate.

Shell has given its investors a multibillion-dollar windfall despite reporting weaker-than-expected profits of $23.7bn (£19bn) for last year as global oil and gas prices tumbled.
Shareholders of Europe's biggest oil company are in line for a 4% dividend increase alongside share buybacks of $3.5bn for the last three months of the year.
This marks the 13th consecutive quarter in which Shell  has given its investors buybacks of more than $3bn, despite falling earnings from its oil and gas.
The company reported adjusted annual earnings of $23.7bn for 2024, narrowly missing the forecasts of City analysts who had expected an annual profit of just over $24bn for the year.

That has not stopped Donald Trump from griping about the Federal Reserve's decision last night to leave its interest rates on hold.

Posting on his social network, Trump wrote:
Because Jay Powell and the Fed failed to stop the problem they created with Inflation, I will do it by unleashing American Energy production, slashing Regulation, rebalancing International Trade, and reigniting American Manufacturing
Trump has previously called for the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates. That makes his complaint about the Fed's handling of inflation somewhat contradictory: the central bank held interest rates steady rather than cutting in an effort to push inflation down.
And many economists believe that several of Trump's policies could themselves be inflationary. Most notably, tariffs are almost always passed onto consumers directly, raising prices of imports or forcing them towards higher-priced products from their home country.
Jerome Powell, the Fed chair, last night declined to provide "any response or comment whatsoever" on the president's public demands for lower rates. During a press conference, he said:
The public should be confident that we will continue to do our work as we always have, focusing on using our tools to achieve our goals.

Eurozone GDP stagnated in the fourth quarter, yet again showing that the economy is in need of some stimulus. It's a tough outlook globally at present and uncertainty over White House policy measures aren't helping.

It was a flash reading on the Eurozone economy, so we don't have the details on what the drivers were. But it's clear that it was a weak end to 2024.
But the European Central Bank might be able to spur a bit of economic growth in the eurozone with looser monetary policy.
Charlie Cornes, senior economist at the Centre for Economics and Business Research, a consultancy, said:
This marks a weak end to last year, following positive growth in the first three quarters of 2024. As a result, first estimates suggest that the currency bloc as a whole grew by 0.7% in 2024. Declining activity in Germany - the Eurozone's largest economy - has weighed on the bloc's growth, with German GDP contracting by 0.2% on the quarter. This suggests Germany has now seen annual declines in activity for two consecutive years.
In 2025, further loosening of monetary conditions is expected to provide a modest uptick in activity for both Germany and the Eurozone, with growth expected to amount to 0.3% and 1.0% respectively.

UK oilfield approvals ruled unlawful on climate grounds
The decision to greenlight a giant new oilfield off Shetland has been ruled unlawful by the courts in a major win for environmental campaigners.
The proposed Rosebank development - the UK's biggest untapped oilfield, due to be developed by Norwegian oil company Equinor - had been given the go-ahead in 2023 under the previous government.
But on Thursday the court of session in Edinburgh sided with campaigners and climate experts in ruling that the original decisions to permit Rosebank and a second, smaller, gas field called Jackdaw were unlawful, as they had not taken into account the carbon emissions created by burning any oil and gas produced. British oil company Shell is due to develop Jackdaw.
Tessa Khan, from the campaign group Uplift which has been at the forefront of the campaign to stop Rosebank , said the court ruling was a significant milestone. "This ... means that Rosebank cannot go ahead without accounting for its enormous climate harm," she said.

A spokesperson for Equinor said it welcomed the judgment, which allows it to continue preparation work on the Rosebank field although it prohibits any drilling.
They said the project would bring investment and jobs to the UK, adding: "We will continue to work closely with the regulators and DESNZ to progress the Rosebank project."
A spokesperson for Shell , the company behind the Jackdaw field, also welcomed the decision, saying it allowed its preparatory work to continue "while new consents are sought. Swift action is needed from the government so that we and other North Sea operators can make decisions about vital UK energy infrastructure."
They added that if Jackdaw went ahead it would provide "enough fuel to heat 1.4m UK homes, at a time when older gas fields are reaching the end of their production and the UK is reliant on imported gas to meet its energy needs."

The eurozone economy did not grow in the final three months of 2024, adding weight to the argument that the European Central Bank will ease interest rates further this year.
Eurozone GDP growth came in at 0% quarter-on-quarter for the fourth quarter of 2024, according to the European Commission. That was a steep drop from the 0.4% growth rate in the previous quarter.
It was also unexpected: a poll of economists by Reuters found that the consensus expectation was for growth of 0.1%.

Germany has now gone two consecutive years with a shrinking economy.
The only reason that it has not been called a "recession" so far is that by convention that word applies to two consecutive quarters of contraction. As the below quarterly GDP chart from Trading Economics  shows, the country has narrowly avoided that fate over the last nine quarters.
The economy has spent the last two years narrowly avoiding the "recession" word, but that will not be much comfort to its citizens - or to chancellor Olaf Scholz as he tries to retain his position at the German elections on 23 February.

The GDP data today show that the German economy shrank by 0.2% year-on-year in 2024, after shrinking by 0.3% in 2023.
It's the first time since the early 2000s that the German economy contracted for two consecutive years, according to Carsten Brzeski, global head of macro at ING, an investment bank. He wrote:
The German economy has now been stuck between cyclical and structural headwinds for several years, and 2024 was finally the year that many politicians realised that the old macro business model of cheap energy and easily accessible large export markets was no longer working.
Ten years of underinvesting, deteriorating competitiveness and China's shift from an export destination to a fierce industrial competitor have taken - and will continue to take - their toll on the German economy. Contrary to the early 2000s when Germany's economic "sickness" or problem was high unemployment and a rigid labour market, the current problems are much more diverse and hence even more difficult to solve than they were 20 years ago.
Let's also not forget that the external environment in the early 2000s was far more favourable for Germany, with China's entry into the World Trade Organization and the EU's enlargement. This contrasts sharply with today's geopolitical tensions, a nearby war, and the rise of protectionism.

German economy contracted more than expected at end of 2024
Germany's economy contracted by more than expected in the fourth quarter of 2024, according to data that suggest the Eurozone economy as a whole may not have expanded.
Germany's GDP dropped by 0.2% quarter-on-quarter in the last three months of the year, according to preliminary data from the statistics office. That was worse than the 0.1% contraction expected by economists polled by Reuters.
France's economy shrank by 0.1% in the quarter, while Italy's economy also recorded zero growth.
The figures underline the rationale for interest rate cuts from the European Central Bank later today.
Andrew Kenningham, chief Europe economist at Capital Economics, a consultancy, said:
With national data now available for all larger euro-zone countries, it looks as if GDP growth in the region slowed to 0.1% q/q or even zero in Q4 last year. The region's two largest economies both contracted and Italy recorded no growth. With the major economies set to remain lacklustre this year even if a major tariff war is avoided, we expect the ECB to cut its deposit rate by 150bp this year to 1.50%, starting with 25bp later today.

Open AI and SoftBank reportedly in talks over $25bn investment
One of the driving forces of market gyrations this week has been concerns over the emergence of DeepSeek, a Chinese artificial intelligence company that appears to have blown rivals out of the water with an AI model that used a fraction of the resources of others.
That threatened to undermine the narrative of ever-increasing use of resources - particularly computing power - that had fuelled the AI boom. Chip maker Nvidia's share price duly plummeted on Monday in the biggest one-day fall in notional value in stock market history.
There has been a notable round of briefing since then from the US competitors led by OpenAI as they try to reassure investors. The latest news reported by the Financial Times, with very helpful timing, is that Japanese investor SoftBank is in talks to invest as much as $25bn in OpenAI.
Donald Trump last week announced a data centre joint venture, dubbed Stargate , between SoftBank and OpenAI - only for it to be overshadowed by DeepSeek.
Yet SoftBank, led by Masayoshi Son, wants to break into AI. The FT cited a person familiar with the matter saying:
The talks are ongoing and the amount that SoftBank could invest in primary equity into OpenAI is a moving target.
That followed briefing yesterday that OpenAI has alleged that DeepSeek "distilled" data from its model , allowing it to skip much of the expensive effort of training AI models. If confirmed, that would violate OpenAI's terms of service.
Owners of the data used by the American company to train its model may be forgiven for at least one eyebrow hitting the ceiling at that complaint. OpenAI has argued in submissions to the UK's House of Lords that it would be impossible for its technology to exist without training on copyrighted material - without the consent of the owners of that material. Tech website Gizmodo wrote  : "OpenAI Claims DeepSeek Plagiarized Its Plagiarism Machine".

The changes could save Royal Mail between £250m and £425m each year. The cuts would be a boon to Czech billionaire Daniel Kretínský  's EP Group , as it nears a £3.6bn takeover of Royal Mail's FTSE 250-listed parent company, International Distribution Services.
