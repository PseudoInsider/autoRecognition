Nations use sacred icons, as empires once did, to win friends and alliancesBy the time the 18th Exposition of the relics of Saint Francis Xavier comes to an end on Sunday, close to 80 lakh pilgrims would have paid a visit to the Se Cathedral in Old Goa, where the relics were kept for veneration since Nov 21.The numbers, almost three million more than the 2014 Exposition, are what the Archdiocese of Goa expected. Affectionately called 'Goencho Saib', the Basque saint is much revered in the state and his relics are and were a major draw for pilgrims around the world."Francis Xavier lived his life in Asia, not just Goa, and after his death, became a global phenomenon," says Fr Victor Ferrao, an independent researcher attached to the SFX Church in Borim. "Goa was a religious and political centre. It was here that permissions and all kinds of resources were obtained."Old Goa was once the capital of Estado da India or Portuguese India.Francis Xavier was Spanish and died in China while on missionary work, but after discovering that his body was 'incorruptible', Portugal instructed that his mortal remains be brought here in 1554. They kept his legacy alive in their Asian colonies, using the relics as a political device to secure alliances and hold on to power."In the case of the Portuguese empire, their decline in power from the seventeenth century onwards forced them to seek global alliances such as the one brokered with the Italian Medici," writes Vishvesh P Kandolkar in 'Goa's Bom Jesus as Visual Culture: The Basilica's Architecture, Image, History and Identity'. "Though the partnerships were meant to be political and even economic ones, objects deemed sacred were an important part of the alliance-building processes; this then allowed institutions such as the Church to become involved."In his recently published book, Kandolkar notes how as a mark of the newly formed understanding between the Portuguese and the Italians, the cushion on which the saint's head rested after his death, was taken from his coffin and sent as a gift to the Grand Duke of Tuscany (Medici) in 1670.In return, Cosimo III de Medici, the Grand Duke of Tuscany, commissioned a large altar-like pedestal for St Francis Xavier's silver casket in Goa, made of polychromatic marbles with ornamentation in semiprecious stones and four bronze relief panels, which depict four events from the life of the saint."This political alliance secured through the exchange of gifts associated with the sacred relics of Xavier was beneficial to both European powers at a time when both were in decline," writes Kandolkar, an associate professor at the Goa College of Architecture.
The Portuguese, though, were not the only ones who found religious relics useful to strengthen ties and win new friends. The British too used it for diplomacy, as the ancient Buddhist corporeal relics were transferred from Piprahwa Kot in Uttar Pradesh to a new relic temple in Thailand in the late nineteenth century.As Sraman Mukherjee writes in 'Relics in Transition: Material Mediations in Changing Worlds', "the British Indian govt had attached a clause to the relic presentation: it was understood that the Siamese monarch would redistribute the relics, once presented, among various Buddhist claimants, particularly the Buddhists of the British Empire, in Burma and Ceylon."More recently, India put relic diplomacy into practice by sharing the relics of the Buddha with Thailand and returning the relics of revered Queen St Ketevan, an integral part of Georgian history and identity.According to several accounts, the queen was killed in Iran for refusing to give up her Christian faith and convert to Islam. Two Augustinian friars secretly witnessed the location of her burial. They brought the relics to Goa and kept them interred in the St Augustine complex in Old Goa. Later in ruins, the relics were discovered by the Archaeological Survey of India (ASI) in 2005.In 2021, India handed the relics over to Georgia, with foreign minister S Jaishankar telling his Georgian counterpart that it was a gift from the people of India."The world is increasingly becoming a global village, and if our shared heritage is fostering bilateral ties and fraternity due to commonality of history and heritage, I feel it's welcome," said historian Prajal Sakhardande. "I interacted with the Georgian delegation of clerics on an invitation from the ASI, regarding Queen Ketevan's relics in Old Goa. In the 21st century, we should build bridges of friendship by sharing our cultural heritage with the rest of the world, without losing our sense of pride and onus of it."
