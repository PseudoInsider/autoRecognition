Elon Musk isn't just disrupting industries anymore-he's playing the part of a self-appointed global power broker, the kind of figure who'd be more at home in a dystopian novel than in today's international political arena. If Jeff Bezos is the corporate embodiment of the American dream, Musk is fast becoming the tech bro equivalent of an African warlord: unpredictable, unrelenting, and unabashedly self-righteous. Musk's journey into political theatrics began at home, in the United States, where he has gleefully upended traditional power structures. His takeover of Twitter-sorry, X-wasn't just a rebranding exercise; it was a declaration of war against the establishment. From shadowbanning critics to amplifying far-right rhetoric, Musk has turned his platform into a digital echo chamber for chaos.
By threatening Republicans for not supporting his libertarian fantasies and whispering economic advice into Donald Trump's ear, Musk has positioned himself as a kind of super president, untethered by any electoral mandate but wielding significant influence nonetheless.Musk Targets World War Rivals-and the 1966 World Cup FinalistsNot content with reshaping American politics, Musk has turned his sights across the Atlantic, where he's simultaneously targeting Germany and the United Kingdom-the same two countries that clashed in the 1966 World Cup final. It's a geopolitical two-for-one that only Musk could orchestrate, seamlessly blending petty grievances with algorithmic warfare.Germany has already felt Musk's ire, with Tesla's European operations frequently clashing with the country's strict environmental laws. But it's in the UK where Musk's campaign has taken on an uncomfortably personal tone. He's zeroed in on Labour Party leader Keir Starmer, accusing him of failing to prosecute grooming gangs during his tenure as Director of Public Prosecutions. Musk's weapon of choiceAct I: Musk's Rise as a Political Powerbroker in the USMusk's transformation from tech mogul to political influencer began in the United States, where his close ties to incoming President Donald Trump and Vice President JD Vance have cemented his status as an informal yet highly influential adviser.From reshaping Twitter-now X-into a megaphone for his libertarian and populist ideals to championing hard-right policies on immigration and federal spending, Musk has become a de facto political player. His tweets regularly serve as policy trial balloons, amplifying far-right talking points and creating division within the Republican Party.In one such example, Musk recently clashed with Trump loyalists over immigration policy, urging mass deportations while simultaneously critiquing the inefficiencies of existing enforcement mechanisms. This sparked a feud within the Trump camp, with some MAGA loyalists accusing Musk of overstepping his bounds. Despite the friction, Musk's influence on the administration's priorities-especially regarding deregulation and fiscal austerity-remains undeniable.Act II: Targeting the UK and Keir Starmer Over RotherhamMusk's sights have not been limited to the US. In the UK, he has inserted himself into one of the country's most politically sensitive topics: the handling of grooming gangs, particularly in Rotherham. Using his platform, Musk has targeted Labour leader Keir Starmer, accusing him of failing to prosecute perpetrators during his tenure as Director of Public Prosecutions.Starmer has dismissed Musk's attacks as "misinformed," while others have criticised Musk for using X's algorithm to amplify far-right narratives about the scandal. Musk's alignment with UK right-wing figures, including Reform UK and certain Tory MPs, has only added to the perception that he is deliberately sowing division.By weaponising one of the most notorious cases of institutional failure in the UK-the Rotherham scandal-Musk has deepened the polarisation surrounding race, crime, and justice. Critics accuse him of ignoring the comprehensive inquiries and systemic reforms already implemented while focusing on inflammatory rhetoric that benefits political factions opposed to Labour.Act III: Backing the Far-Right AfD in GermanyMusk's foray into German politics marks perhaps his most audacious move yet. His public endorsement of the far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) has upended political discourse in a country deeply sensitive to extremist ideologies.In a guest opinion piece for Welt am Sonntag, Musk denied the AfD's extremist nature, citing party leader Alice Weidel's same-sex partnership with a Sri Lankan woman as evidence. "Does that sound like Hitler to you? Please!" Musk wrote, dismissing Germany's domestic intelligence classification of the AfD as a suspected extremism case.The article provoked an immediate backlash. Eva Marie Kogel, the paper's opinion editor, resigned in protest, citing the publication as a violation of journalistic integrity. Meanwhile, Welt's leadership defended the decision to publish Musk's piece, framing it as a commitment to free speech and public debate.Underneath Musk's essay, the newspaper's editor-in-chief designate, Jan Philipp Burgard, published a counterargument, describing Musk's endorsement of the AfD as "fatally false." Burgard highlighted the AfD's Eurosceptic, pro-Russia, and anti-China positions as contrary to Germany's national interests.Musk's Claim to Global InfluenceMusk's justification for these interventions is as bold as his actions. He claims that his "significant investments" in Germany, the US, and the UK give him a vested interest in their political stability and direction. In Germany, he pointed to Tesla's Gigafactory Berlin as evidence of his stake in the country's future, while in the UK, he framed his criticisms of Starmer as part of a broader commitment to justice reform.This narrative of global responsibility has allowed Musk to frame his actions as benevolent rather than disruptive, but many see his interventions as a dangerous consolidation of power. By leveraging X's algorithm to amplify his viewpoints, Musk has created an unprecedented feedback loop where his influence directly shapes public discourse and political agendas.A Global Pattern of DisruptionMusk's moves in the US, UK, and Germany reveal a consistent pattern: using populist rhetoric to exploit existing fractures in society. In each case, he aligns himself with far-right movements or figures, framing his interventions as a defense of free speech and democratic values.In the US, he has empowered libertarian and nationalist factions while challenging the Republican establishment. In the UK, he has weaponised one of the country's most divisive issues to undermine Labour's leadership.In Germany, he has lent credibility to a party that many view as a threat to the post-war democratic consensus.The Risks of Musk's Global Power PlayElon Musk's rise as a global disruptor has sparked comparisons to a modern-day bermensch, wielding technology, wealth, and influence in ways that can reshape-or destabilise-the world. Like Superman, Musk is a figure of immense power, but unlike the comic book hero, his motives remain opaque, his allegiances fluid, and his accountability non-existent. What happens if this self-styled saviour decides the world doesn't align with his vision? As Musk's interventions grow bolder, so does the unease: not because he can destroy nations with a flick of his wrist, but because he might already be doing so-algorithm by algorithm, tweet by tweet.
