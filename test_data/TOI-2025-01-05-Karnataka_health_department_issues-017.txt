Bengaluru: Amid concerns about the spread of human metapneumovirus (HMPV) in China, the health department confirmed there are no reported cases of the illness in the state.
According to Harsh Gupta, principal secretary of health and family welfare, Karnataka, the state did not see any notable rise in common cold, ILI and SARI cases in Dec 2024 when compared to previous year.
"HMPV is a respiratory illness that causes cold and flu-like symptoms during winter, particularly affecting children and elderly individuals," Dr Ansar Ahmed, project director of integrated disease surveillance programme (IDSP) told STOI.
As a preventive step, the department has issued guidelines for the public - to avoid crowded areas, practise proper respiratory hygiene and clean hands using soap, water or alcohol-based sanitiser. People with fever, cough or sneezing are advised to stay home. Adequate hydration and nutritious diet have been recommended.
The department advised against reuse of tissue paper, close contact with ill individuals and sharing personal items like towels and linen. Additional precautions include avoiding spitting in public spaces, minimising face touching and refraining from self-medication.
