Matthew Livelsberger, a decorated Special Forces soldier, sought treatment for depression in the months leading up to a shocking suicide bombing involving a Tesla Cybertruck outside the Trump International Hotel in Las Vegas this week. The 37-year-old, who reportedly battled PTSD, guilt from combat, and family issues, had expressed a desire to seek further help, according to his ex-girlfriend, Army nurse Alicia Arritt."He wanted to get more help," said Arritt, 39, who dated Livelsberger from 2018 to 2021. "I think it was even harder for him, being on active duty - the shame and the stigma," reported New York Post.The final noteLivelsberger left a haunting note in his charred cellphone, recovered after the explosion, which read: "I needed to cleanse my mind of the brothers I've lost and relieve myself of the burden of the lives I took." FBI officials noted on Friday that Livelsberger "likely" suffered from PTSD and had ongoing "family issues."Despite attending three mental health counseling sessions between August and December, it remains unclear whether he was assessed as a risk for suicide or violence.Combat injuries and personal strugglesArritt revealed that Livelsberger, proud of his nearly two decades in the military, had suffered multiple concussions during combat and undergone back surgery due to injuries sustained from parachute jumps. Still, he struggled with sleeping, focusing, and maintaining relationships.Livelsberger left his Colorado home on December 26 after his wife, with whom he shared a baby daughter, left him over cheating allegations, according to sources.
He then rented a Tesla Cybertruck through the Turo app and drove to Las Vegas. Hours before the explosion, video footage from the vehicle's cameras captured him calmly clearing dirt off the bumper while wearing a T-shirt with the logo of fireworks manufacturer Black Cat.The tragic incidentOn January 1, Livelsberger packed the Cybertruck with explosives and fireworks before shooting himself in the head and triggering the blast. Several people in the hotel's valet area sustained injuries from the explosion.Arritt, who treated veterans with brain injuries at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center, described Livelsberger as a man burdened by his military service. She recalled asking him about his injuries when they first met, to which he replied, "Just some concussions."Unverified claims and conspiracy theoriesLivelsberger had also emailed claims about national security threats before his death. In an email revealed on The Shawn Ryan Podcast, the soldier alleged that federal officials were working with China to develop drones, which he called "the most dangerous threat to national security." Officials are still verifying the email's legitimacy.No connection to New Orleans attackFederal authorities ruled out any link between Livelsberger's bombing and another New Year's Day attack in New Orleans. In that incident, ISIS-affiliated ex-soldier Shamsud-Din Jabbar drove a truck into a Bourbon Street crowd, killing 14 people before being shot dead by police.A soldier's burdenLivelsberger's tragic story highlights the challenges faced by veterans struggling with mental health issues and the lasting impact of combat trauma. His ex-girlfriend reflected, "He was so proud of his service, but I think it came with a lot of guilt. He carried a heavy burden, and he wanted to make it right."The FBI continues to investigate the incident and Livelsberger's final days.
