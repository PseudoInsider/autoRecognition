A couple visiting from Mobile, Ala., saw the driver veer his pickup onto Bourbon Street and slam into New Year's revelers.
The French Quarter was still packed with people after 3 a.m. on Wednesday, when Michael Stricklin and his wife, Kimberly Stricklin, began walking across Canal Street at the intersection with Bourbon Street and saw a pickup barreling in their direction.
The truck accelerated as it approached the intersection, Mr. Stricklin said, and the driver took a wide right turn into Bourbon Street and into the crowd of revelers. "There were two cops at the corner when he plowed through the barricade," he said.
Mr. Stricklin was visiting with his wife from Mobile, Ala., to attend three nights of New Year's concerts in New Orleans.
The truck then hurtled farther into the crowd, Mrs. Stricklin said. "It just took a moment to register, it was just so frightening. It was like something out of a horror movie."
Dozens of police cars raced several blocks up Canal Street from a casino parking lot - scene of an unrelated shooting - to Bourbon Street. "They were here within two minutes," Mrs. Stricklin said. Fourteen people were killed in the attack.
Alex Gonzalez, a tourist from Mexico City, said that he watched New Year's fireworks over the Mississippi River, then walked several blocks north to Bourbon Street to continue celebrating.
He was walking to his hotel through a crowd when he heard a prolonged crash ahead of him, and people began screaming. He kept walking and found himself among injured bodies lying in the street. "You are not expecting something like this," he said.
