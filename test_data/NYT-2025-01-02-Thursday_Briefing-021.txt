A deadly attack in New Orleans.
At least 15 people died in an attack in New Orleans
At least 15 people were killed and dozens more were injured in the early hours of New Year's Day when a driver rammed a pickup truck into revelers on Bourbon Street in New Orleans - the deadliest act of mass murder in the U.S. in more than a year.
The suspect, a 42-year-old Army veteran from Texas, was identified by the F.B.I. as Shamsud-Din Bahar Jabbar. He died in a shootout with the police.
Jabbar, a lifelong resident of Texas, served several years in the Army and was honorably discharged. He recently converted to Islam and began behaving erratically, according to his ex-wife's husband. An Islamic State flag, weapons and a potential explosive device were found in the truck that officials say he used in the attack. Officials said they were also investigating other potential bombs found in the French Quarter. Here's what we know about him.
The investigation: The ISIS flag and potential bombs have raised the specter that the international terrorist group played a role in the attack. It has left a brutal legacy of death and destruction across the world.
White House: President Biden condemned the attack, citing the F.B.I. as saying that the driver posted videos on social media "mere hours" earlier "indicating that he was inspired by ISIS."
Ukraine halted the flow of Russian natural gas to Europe
Ukraine refused yesterday to renew an agreement that allowed the country's territory to be used as a corridor for Russian gas to travel to Europe, according to officials in both countries.
The move is part of a broader campaign by Ukraine and its Western allies to undermine the ability of Russia to fund its war effort, but there are risks. Moscow could retaliate by bombing Ukraine's pipelines, a vast network that has been largely spared over the past three years of conflict.
Details: Europe was prepared for the move, so analysts expect little effect on gas prices there. Hungary, Austria and several Balkan countries still use Russian gas delivered through Ukraine, but experts say that existing stockpiles and alternative supplies should prevent cuts to electricity and heating in those countries. Slovakia, which is still heavily dependent on Russian gas, threatened to retaliate against Ukraine.
In Syria, the challenge of rebuilding
The rebels who seized power in Syria now face a sizable task of trying to put the country back together after more than a decade of civil war. They are inheriting a devastated military infrastructure that will be hard to capitalize on or rebuild.
The country's new leadership recently announced a plan to unite the various rebel factions under one government and for their armed fighters to serve together in one army. Many combatants said they had already accepted a single command under Ahmad al-Shara and his rebel force, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, but bitterness and divisions are likely to continue with forces that remain in opposition.

Fitness goals are often aesthetic. Consider instead pursuing a fitness resolution that has nothing to do with how you look, like learning a skill, accomplishing a physical feat or simply building a habit.
